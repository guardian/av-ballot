  on instant runoff voting (called "preferential voting" in RRO):
  > If at any point two or more candidates or propositions are tied for the least popular
  > position, the ballots in their piles are redistributed in a single step, all of the tied
  > names being treated as eliminated. In the event of a tie in the winning position—which would

  > equal piles—the election should be resolved in favor of the candidate or proposition that was
  > strongest in terms of first choices (by referring to the record of the first distribution).
